# Extracting-Text-From-Image
# 🧾 AI-Powered OCR-Based Expense Tracker  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **AI-Powered OCR-Based expense tracker** that extracts transaction details from receipts and categorizes expenses using **OCR and Machine Learning**. Users can upload an image of a receipt, and the system will automatically extract and store details such as:  

✅ **Date**  
✅ **Vendor**  
✅ **Amount**  
✅ **Expense Category (via ML Model)**  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ **Upload Receipt Images**  
✔️ **Extract Text from Receipts using OCR (Tesseract + OpenCV)**  
✔️ **Preprocess Images for Better OCR Accuracy**  
✔️ **Store Transaction Details in a Database** *(Upcoming Feature)*   
✔️ **ML-Based Expense Categorization** *(Upcoming Feature)*  
✔️ **Expense Tracking & Visualization** *(Upcoming Feature)*  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **OCR & Image Processing:** OpenCV, Tesseract OCR  
- **Database:** SQLite  (Planned)  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn 
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
